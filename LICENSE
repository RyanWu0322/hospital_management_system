## Academic Project Notice

This project was originally developed as coursework for "Web Programming"
on April 9, 2024, and subsequently enhanced with enterprise-level security
improvements. The project demonstrates the evolution from basic web
programming concepts to secure application development practices.

### Original Assignment Context
- Course: Web Programming (網路程式設計)
- Assignment Date: 2024-04-09
- Enhancement Period: 2025-02 to 2025-03
- Primary Focus: Security hardening and code quality improvements

### Educational Use
This software is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
For production use, additional security auditing and performance
optimization are recommended.

### Security Enhancements Applied
- SQL injection prevention using prepared statements
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection with output encoding
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
- Secure file upload handling
- Session management security improvements
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

The enhancements transform this basic academic project into a demonstration
of modern web application security best practices.
